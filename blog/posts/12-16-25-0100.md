**FINALLY** got a blog system going again using PHP. I am using Markdown language which is cool. I have seen .md files before but was not sure how they work.

It is easier than typing HTML for breaks and things.

I am delighted. I will work on getting more comfortable with Markdown syntax.

I have a PHP parser that parses the Markdown file and displays it as HTML. =)
