store your blogs (.txt files) in /blogs

uses the name of the .txt files as a blog header.

Remove the path directory from the header in blogs.php just do a search for the string below:

'remove the directory path from the display header'

Known issue:

some blog titles get truncated.. could be just my hosting provider's path locations.. Not sure what is going on but will investigate 3/2/23
